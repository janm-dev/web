**Your privacy is critically important to us. At janm.ml, we have a few fundamental principles:**

- We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
- We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
- We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Hi! We are the team behind janm.ml. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

- Our website (janm.ml);
- Our other products, services, and features;

Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites, and other products and services collectively as "Services". Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

## Creative Commons Sharealike License

This is a modified version of Automattic's Privacy Policy. They've decided to make their Privacy Policy available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. You can grab a copy of that Privacy Policy and other legal documents on their [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic). Similarly this version of the policy is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/janmml/web). If you want to use this Privacy Policy, we recommend modifying their version of it, though. Regardless, you're more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, Automattic would appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so - for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from two sources: if and when you provide information to us, and automatically through operating our Services. Let's go over the information that we collect.

### Information You Provide to Us

It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

- **Basic information:** We may ask for basic information from you in order to set up an account or use certain services. We store and process this information to provide the service and enable communication with you.

- **Communications with us (hi there!):** You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Helper team about a support question, or post a question in our public forums. When you communicate with us via form, email, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.

- **Communications through our services:** When you choose to use the chat (or a similar feature) in one of our services, we may store a copy of your messages.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect some information automatically:

- **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, and operating system. We collect log information when you use our Services - for example, when you access one of our websites.

- **Location information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.

- **Session and user identifiers:** We may use personal identifiers stored in cookies or other similar technologies to enable personalized content. This is always done with your consent, and only when you are signed in to an account in one of our services.

- **User preference information:** We may store configuration information in cookies or other similar technologies to enable personalized content that aligns with your personal preferences. Whenever practical, this information is stored only on your device.

## How and Why We Use Information

### Purposes for Using Information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- **To provide our Services.** For example, to be able to provide you access to our website.

- **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by focusing our efforts on improving our most-used services first.

- **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting our and others' rights and property.

- **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by customizing our service to fit your personal stylistic preferences.

- **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.

- **To communicate with you.** For example, by answering your support questions and emails.

### Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to provide our services, like our website; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information - for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; and to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; or (5) You have given us your consent.

## Sharing Information

### How We Share Information

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below:

- **Independent contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf.

- **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.

- **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.

- **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.

- **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.

- **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.

### Information Shared Publicly

Information that you choose to make public is - you guessed it - disclosed publicly. That means information that you make public on our Services is available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

## How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it - described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information - and we're not legally required to keep it.

## Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We also monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

- **Limit the information that you provide us:** You can choose not to provide optional information by not using certain features, like, for example, contact features in some of our Services.

- **Limit the amount of public information you share:** You can limit the amount of public information you share through our services.

- **Close your account(s):** You can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above - for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.

## Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the "GDPR"), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

### European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

- Request access to your personal data;
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
- Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
- Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
- Request portability of your personal data.

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the "categories" of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from our users, depending on the Services used:

- Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);

- Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as a user of one of our Services);

- Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address); and

- Inferences we make (such as likelihood of being a human user or a bot).

You can find more information about what we collect in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:

- Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;

- Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;

- Opt out of any sale of personal information; and

- Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

### Contacting Us About These Rights

To contact us about your rights, scroll down to "How to Reach Us" to, well, find out how to reach us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we'll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to provide some information about yourself, like your IP address or username, depending on the Service. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.

## Data Controller

The controller of our users' information is Jan Markiewicz, ul. Radziwiłłów 27, 32-083 Balice, Polska.

## How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us through the contact channels listed on our [contact page](/contact).

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "last change" date below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
