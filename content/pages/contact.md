## Contact

### Email

You can contact us via email at [contact@janm.ml](mailto:contact@janm.ml).

This is the recommended contact method for private communication, and most emails should receive a reply within a few days.

To contact _me_ personally, you can use [jan@markiewicz.email](mailto:contact@janm.ml?subject=janm%20contact%20%7C%20). I don't guarantee reading or answering emails sent to this address.

### Discord

You can also join our [Discord server](/discord) and contact us there.

This is the recommended contact method for general questions and support, and you should get an answer faster than by email.
