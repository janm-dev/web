			<h1 id="info">Info</h1>
			<p>The janm.ml Minecraft Server is a vanilla-like survival 1.15.2 Minecraft server running on Spigot with only some minor modifications.</p>
			<p>It will be updated to every new Minecraft version, once every piece of software the server uses has been updated and it was tested on the most recent backup of the server world to not break anything (changes in game mechanics notwithstanding).</p>
			<p>The server will also be backed up often as well as sometimes go down for maintenance. During this time you will not be able to play. You can check the status of the server and see if there is a maintenance window planned or if something went wrong <a href="#status" class="link">below</a>. Don't worry, if there is a problem, I probably already know about it and am either working on it, or not available. Spamming messages will only slow down server maintenance work.</p>
			<p>The server is not open to everyone (it uses the normal whitelist system), but you can get on that whitelist and start playing on the server by registering <a href="#registration" class="link">below</a>.</p>
			<h3>Other random info:</h3>
			<p>The seed for the server world is -3122104141486301182.<br>
			That seed was chosen out of 10 candidates, wich were randomly picked in-game.<br>
			The difficulty is locked at "hard".<br>
			Those images above were not taken on the server.<br>
			This server uses a mix of custom plugins and <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/" class="link">VanillaTweaks</a>.</p>

			<p>5.&nbsp;Cheating, hacking, duplicating items or blocks, etc. is not allowed.<br>
